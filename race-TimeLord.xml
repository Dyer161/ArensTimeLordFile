		<description>
			<p> Time Lords look completely identical to any standard humanoid race , with two somewhat noticeable variations. First, Time Lords have a binary vascular system. This means that instead of having one heart, like most humanoid race, Time Lords have two hearts. The other major difference between Time Lords and humanoids is their life span. Time Lords can live for millennia, partially because they can regenerate their bodies and emerge with a new one, and partially because each body can live for centuries.</p>
			<p> The Time Lords have a very long history, and have lived in the universe almost since it was born. They originate from a planet called Gallifrey, but have influenced great portions of the universe. Time Lords were the first beings to invent time travel along with many other significant inventions, such as black holes, TARDISes, and interdimensional travel, technology equaled only by the Daleks, several millennia later. Time Lords used to be common sights across the universe, but ever since their Time War against the Daleks, they have moved themselves and the entire planet of Gallifrey billions of years into the future, and live quiet lives, away from the chaos of the universe. Time Lords have since vanished from the memories of most, and they, along with the Daleks, are now regarded as little more than fairy tales.</p>
			<p>Time Lords, while highly advanced, tend to remain far away from other species' affairs, and abide to strict codes of non-interference. In spite of this, Time Lords are fairly pompous, and some believe that Time Lords' removal from other cultures is a result of arrogance and a mindset that most other races are inferior to them.</p>
			<h4>Time Lord TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your Time Lord character has the following traits in common with all other Time Lords.</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<b><i>Age. </i>
				</b>For every body that they use, Time Lords typically live to about a few millennium. </p>
			<p class="indent">
				<b><i>Alignment. </i>
				</b>Time Lords do not like to interfere with others, and are usually lawful or true neutral. Being an adventurer, however, you are probably much more inclined towards a chaotic good or neutral. </p>
			<p class="indent">
				<b><i>Size. </i>
				</b>Time Lords, like humans, vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium. </p>
			<p class="indent">
				<b><i>Speed. </i>
				</b>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i>
				</b>Your Wisdom score increases by 1, and your Intelligence score increases by 2</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<b><i>Languages. </i>
				</b>You can speak, read and write Gallifreyan, along with two additional languages. </p>
			<p class="indent">
				<b><i>Binary Vascular System. </i>
				</b>As a result of having two hearts, when you roll for death saving throws, you may reroll 1's. </p>
			<p class="indent">
				<b><i>Foreign Physiology. </i>
				</b>Because of your highly alien biology, you may take different effects from certain potions and medicines. Whenever you consume a healing potion that you have never consumed before, roll 1d8. On a 1, you take a number of damage equal to the amount you would have normally healed of. This trait does not take effect with spells and only happens the first time you drink it. </p>

	<element name="Regeneration" type="Racial Trait" source="Aren's Time Lord File :)" id="ID_AREN_RACIAL_TRAIT_TIMELORD_REGENERATION">
		<description>
			<p>When you reach 0 hit points, instead of making death saving throws, you may instead choose to regenerate. When you decide to regenerate, two lines of radiant energy originating from you extend to 10 feet in any direction of your choice, along with a third beam, which shoots directly upward for 10 feet. Any creatures touching these beams make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d12 radiant damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. The regeneration process lasts for one round, during which if you take damage, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 plus the amount of damage taken; on a failed save, you are automatically killed. After regenerating, the beams of light disappear and you are restored to full health with a new body.</p>

After regenerating, the beams of light disappear and you are restored to full health with a new body. In order to create your new body, take the following steps:</description>
			<p class ="indent">1. Re-roll for your height and weight.
				<p>2. Re-roll for a new personality trait (this must be different from your last three bodies).</p>
				<p>3. Roll 1d4 (1=if your Charisma score is greater than 1, decrease your Charisma score by 1, otherwise, do nothing; 2-3=do not change your Charisma score; 4=if your Charisma score is less than 20, increase your Charisma score by 1, otherwise, do nothing).</p>
				<p>4. Describe your new appearance, including selecting a gender, eye color, skin color, and hair color (at least one of these must be different from your previous body). Note that no two bodies can be identical; there must be some noticeable differences between your new body and all of your other ones.</p>
				<p>
					<b>
						<i>For 8 hours after regenerating, you heal of 1 hit point at the beginning of each round, you subtract 5 feet to your speed, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, you are afflicted with a form of long-term madness for the first 24 hours after your regeneration. You cannot use this ability more than 12 times, unless your DM creates some circumstance which gives you another regeneration cycle (12 regenerations) from the Time Lord government. After you have exhausted all of your regenerations, you must make death saving throws as usual if you reach 0 hit points. Even if you are resurrected after dying through a different process, you do not regain spent regenerations.</i>
